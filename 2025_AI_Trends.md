# 2025 Agent Frameworks: Incumbents vs Challengers

## Incumbents

### LangGraph 1.0
- LangGraph 1.0, released in late 2025, is a significant update to the popular AI agent framework by LangChain.
- Key features:
  - Durable execution and short-term memory for agent workflows
  - Streaming support for real-time agent interactions
  - Human-in-the-loop patterns for agent oversight and collaboration
  - Production-ready reliability features like fault tolerance and observability

### Microsoft AutoGen
- Microsoft's AutoGen framework has also reached a major 1.0 milestone in 2025, with a focus on scalable and extensible agent architectures.
- Key updates in v0.4:
  - Streaming tools for real-time agent interactions
  - Improved agent execution models for complex multi-step tasks
  - Tight integration with Microsoft's wider agent and AI ecosystem

## Challengers

### CoreSpeed Zypher
- Zypher is a new agent framework developed by CoreSpeed, a rising challenger in the AI agent space.
- Key Zypher features:
  - Agent-centric design, with autonomous tool invocation and error correction
  - Git-based checkpoint management for versioning and rollback
  - Composable and plug-and-play architecture for rapid agent development

Zypher stands out as a powerful new entrant, challenging the incumbent frameworks with its agent-native approach and focus on developer productivity and reliability.

## Comparison
When comparing the top frameworks, a few key differentiators emerge:

**Incumbents (LangGraph, AutoGen)**:
- Mature, battle-tested platforms with extensive community support
- Deeper integration with broader AI and ML ecosystems
- Stronger focus on enterprise-grade features like observability and governance

**Challenger (Zypher)**: 
- Novel agent-centric design philosophy
- Greater emphasis on developer experience and rapid prototyping
- Innovative versioning and error-handling capabilities

Overall, the 2025 agent framework landscape shows a mix of well-established incumbents and disruptive challengers, each with their own unique strengths. Organizations evaluating these tools will need to carefully weigh their specific needs and priorities to determine the best fit.
