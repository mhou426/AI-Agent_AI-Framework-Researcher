Understood, let's begin the research to find the top 3 AI Agent Frameworks of late 2025.# 2025 AI Agent Frameworks

Based on the search results, here are the top 3 AI Agent Frameworks as of late 2025:

1. **CoreSpeed Zypher Framework**:
   - Zypher is an open-source agentic AI framework developed by CoreSpeed, a leading AI research and engineering company.
   - Key features include autonomous tool invocation, indexing, memory storage, checkpoint management, and code/visual error correction.
   - Zypher enables developers to quickly build production-grade AI agents in days rather than months.
   - The framework adopts a plug-and-play component design, allowing for composable and autonomously callable tools.

2. **LangGraph**:
   - LangGraph is a stable 1.0 release in the durable agent framework space, developed by the team behind LangChain.
   - LangGraph provides flexibility with a new concept of middleware, and focuses on the core agent loop where the agent dynamically decides next steps based on LLM reasoning.
   - The framework aims to help developers get LLMs into production by providing a robust and scalable infrastructure for building agentic AI systems.
   - LangGraph 1.0 was announced in October 2025 as a major milestone, unlocking the full potential of scalable agentic systems.

3. **Microsoft AutoGen**:
   - AutoGen is an open-source development kit for building AI agents and multi-agent workflows, released by Microsoft.
   - The 0.4 version, released in January 2025, features a re-designed architecture focused on improved code quality, robustness, usability, and scalability of agentic systems.
   - AutoGen enables deterministic and dynamic agentic workflows for business processes, as well as research on multi-agent collaboration.
   - The framework is available for both .NET and Python, and provides a migration guide for developers transitioning from the previous AutoGen version.

These three AI agent frameworks - Zypher, LangGraph, and AutoGen - appear to be the leading solutions in the market as of late 2025, providing advanced capabilities for quickly building production-ready agentic AI systems.
